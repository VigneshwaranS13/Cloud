## Module 1 Summary

Cloud computing is the delivery of on-demand computing resources over the internet on a pay-as-you-go basis; resources are dynamically assigned and reassigned among multiple users and scale up and down in response to users’ needs.

- The origins of cloud computing can be traced back to the mainframes of the 1950s, with virtualization technologies and hypervisors serving as catalysts for the emergence of modern-day cloud computing.

- Organizations must consider their business needs, investment viability, and risk capacity in order to create a cloud adoption strategy that delivers desired benefits without causing business disruptions and security, compliance, or performance issues.

- Cloud adoption is growing faster than predicted. Driving this technological wave are cloud service providers with a host of services ranging from Infrastructure, Platform, and Software services. Some major Cloud providers of our times include AWS, Alibaba Cloud, Google, IBM Cloud, and Microsoft Azure.

 ## Module 2 Summary
 
 1. The adoption of cloud technologies is enabling enterprises, big and small, to be agile, innovative, and competitive, and to create differentiated customer experiences. The question organizations are asking is not whether they should move to the cloud, rather what strategy they should adopt to move to the cloud.

## Module 3 Summary
1. Cloud computing allows us to utilize technology as a service, leveraging remote resources on-demand, on a pay-as-you-model. There are three main service models available on the cloud—Infrastructure-as-a-Service, Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS).

- IaaS provides the fundamental compute, network, and storage resources for customers on-demand.
- PaaS provides customers the hardware, software, and infrastructure to develop, deploy, manage, and run applications created by them or acquired from a third-party.
- SaaS provides access to users to a service provider’s cloud-based software. Users simply access the applications on Cloud while the Cloud provider maintains the infrastructure, platform, data, application code, security, availability, and performance of the application.

2. Deployment models indicate where the infrastructure resides, who owns and manages it, and how cloud resources and services are made available to users. There are three main deployment models available on the cloud—Public, Private, and Hybrid.

- In the Public cloud model, the service provider owns, manages, provisions, and maintains the physical infrastructure such as data centers, servers, networking equipment, and storage, with users accessing virtualized compute, networking, and storage resources as services.

- In the Private cloud model, the provider provisions the cloud infrastructure for exclusive use by a single organization. The private cloud infrastructure can be internal to the organization and run or on-premises. Or, it can be on a public cloud, as in the case of Virtual Private Clouds (VPC) and be owned, managed, and operated by the cloud provider.

- In the Hybrid cloud model, an organization’s on-premise private cloud and third-party, public cloud is connected as a single, flexible infrastructure leveraging the features and benefits of both Public and Private clouds.

## Module 4 Summary

1. Cloud infrastructure consists of data centers, storage, networking components, and compute resources.
2. Virtualization is the process of creating a software-based version of physical resources, made possible through the use of hypervisors. 
3. A few different types of Virtual Machines can be provisioned on the cloud. These include:
 
- Shared or Public Cloud VMs that are provider-managed, multi-tenant deployments that can be provisioned on-demand with predefined sizes
- Transient or Spot VMs that take advantage of unused capacity in a cloud data center
- Reserved VMs that allow you to reserve capacity and guarantee resources for future deployments 
- Dedicated hosts that offer single-tenant isolation

4. Bare metal servers are single-tenant physical servers that are dedicated to a single customer. Bare metal servers fulfil the demanding needs of high-performance computing (HPC) and data intense applications and are ideal for applications that have a high degree of security or compliance requirements.

5. Networking capabilities in the cloud are delivered as a service rather than in the form of rack-mounted devices. Cloud resources, such as VMs (or VSIs), storage, network connectivity, and load balancers, are deployed into subnets within Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs). Using private and public subnets allows users to deploy multi-tier enterprise applications securely. Load balancers distribute the traffic and allow applications to be responsive.

6. Containers are an executable unit of software in which application code is packaged, along with its libraries and dependencies, in common ways so that it can be run anywhere—desktops, traditional IT, or the cloud. Containers are lighter weight and consume fewer resources than Virtual Machines - helping streamline the development and deployment of cloud native applications.

## Module 5 Summary

1. Cloud storage is available in four main types–Direct Attached, File, Block, and Object Storage. These storage types differ in how they can be accessed, the capacity they offer, how much they cost, the types of data they are best suited to store, and their read-write speed.
2. Direct Attached (or Local) Storage is storage that is presented directly to a cloud-based server and is effectively either within the host server chassis or within the same rack.
3. File Storage is typically presented to compute nodes as a Network File System (NFS), which means that the storage is connected to compute nodes over a standard ethernet network.
4. Block Storage is presented to compute nodes using high-speed fibre connections, typically provisioned in volumes, which are mounted onto a compute node.  
5. Object Storage is accessed via an API and doesn’t need an underlying compute node. Object Storage offers infinite capacity as you can keep adding files to it and just pay for what you use. Compared to the other storage types, object storage is slowest in terms of read and write speeds.
6. A Content Delivery Network (CDN is a distributed server network that accelerates internet content delivery by delivering temporarily stored or cached copies of website or media content to users based on their geographic location.

## Module 6 Summary

1. Hybrid Multicloud is a cloud adoption strategy that makes it possible for public clouds, private clouds, and on-premises IT to interoperate seamlessly while leveraging the best cloud-based services from different public cloud providers.

2. Microservices architecture is an approach in which an application is built as a collection of loosely coupled and independently deployable components or services, leading to efficient development, maintenance, and upgradation cycles.

3. Serverless Computing is an approach to computing that offloads responsibility for common infrastructure management tasks for application runtimes to cloud providers, allowing developers to focus their time and effort on development and testing, and not have to worry about provisioning, maintaining and scaling compute resources.

4. Cloud native applications are applications that are built or refactored to work in the cloud environment. These applications, developed using DevOps methodologies, consist of microservices packaged in containers that can run in any environment—making it possible to create and update features in quick iterative cycles.

5. DevOps is a collaborative approach that enables development and operations teams to continuously deliver software in quick iterative cycles while reducing overhead, duplication, and rework. DevOps’ tools, practices, and processes help tackle the complexities and challenges posed by the cloud, allowing solutions to be delivered and updated —quickly and reliably.

6. Application Modernization helps organizations accelerate their digital transformation, take advantage of new technologies and services, and become more responsive to changing market dynamics. Cloud computing is one of the key enablers of application modernization

## Module 7 Summary

1. Cloud security refers to the policies, technological procedures, services, and solutions designed to secure the enterprise applications and data on cloud against insider threats, data breaches, compliance issues, and organized security threats. 

2. Cloud security is a shared responsibility between the cloud provider and the user organization. 

3. Security architecture and methods for achieving continuous security need to be embedded through the life cycle of an application to ensure that the application runs on a safe platform, the code is free from vulnerabilities, and the operational risks are understood. 

4. There needs to be active monitoring of all connected systems and cloud-based services to maintain visibility of all data exchanges between public, private, and hybrid cloud environments. This ensures that the cloud provides a trusted platform that can securely integrate with your enterprise data centers.

5.  Businesses all over the world are realizing tangible benefits from the use of cloud technologies and services. 

6. The Weather Company migrating to the cloud to reliably deliver critical weather data at high speed, especially during major weather events such as hurricanes and tornadoes
